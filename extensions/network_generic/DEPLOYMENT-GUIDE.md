# OCI Landing Zone Generic Network Extension Deployment Guide

This template shows how to deploy network resources for a generic workload using an OCI Core Landing Zone configuration.
Compartments, groups and policies are deployed to facilitate "segregation of duties" for an application workload on the landing zone base layer.

The following prerequisite resources are assumed to exist prior to deploying this extension:

- A foundation landing zone with minimal, basic network structure.

As a post-requisite, add Security Lists and NSG based on your network environment:
- Ingress and Egress Rules: define allowed inbound and outbound TCP ports, e.g. ports for SSH (22), HTTPS (443), etc.

For a detailed description of all variables that can be used, see the [Variables](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/terraform-oci-core-landingzone/blob/main/VARIABLES.md) documentation.

This template can be deployed using OCI Resource Manager Service (RMS) or Terraform CLI:

## OCI RMS Deployment

With the stack created, perform a Plan, followed by an Apply using RMS UI.

## Terraform CLI Deployment

1. Rename file *main.tf.template* to *main.tf*.
2. Provide/review the variable assignments in *main.tf*.
3. In this folder, execute the typical Terraform workflow:

	``
	terraform init
	``
	
	``
	terraform plan
	``
	
	``

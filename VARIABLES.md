### General

| Variable Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----|----------|
| service\_label | A unique label that gets prepended to all resources deployed by the Landing Zone. Max length: 15 characters. | `any` | | yes |
| cis\_level | Determines CIS OCI Benchmark Level to apply on Landing Zone managed resources. Level 1 is be practical and prudent. Level 2 is intended for environments where security is more critical than manageability and usability. Level 2 drives the creation of an OCI Vault, buckets encryption with a customer managed key, write logs for buckets and the usage of specific policies in Security Zones. | `string` | 1 | no |
| customize\_iam | Whether Landing Zone IAM settings are to be customized. Customizable options are identity domains, groups, dynamic groups and policies. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| define\_net | Whether networking is defined as part of this Landing Zone. By default, no networking resources are created. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| display\_output | Whether to display a concise set of select resource outputs with their OCIDs and names. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| extend\_landing\_zone\_to\_new\_region | Whether Landing Zone is being extended to another region. When set to true, compartments, groups, policies and resources at the home region are not provisioned. Use this when you want to provision a Landing Zone in a new region, but reuse existing Landing Zone resources in the home region. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| lz\_provenant\_prefix | The provenant landing zone prefix or code that identifies the client of this Landing Zone. This information goes into a freeform tag applied to all deployed resources. | `string` | `core` | no |
| lz\_provenant\_version | The provenant landing zone version. This information goes into a freeform tag applied to all deployed resources. | `string` | `null` | no |
| enable\_zpr | Whether ZPR is enabled as part of this Landing Zone. By default, no ZPR resources are created. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| zpr\_namespace\_name | The name of ZPR security attribute namespace. | `string` | `<service_label>-zpr` | no |

| cloud\_guard\_risk\_level\_threshold | Determines the minimum Risk level that triggers sending Cloud Guard problems to the defined Cloud Guard Email Endpoint. E.g. a setting of High will send notifications for Critical and High problems. | `string` | `High` | no |
| enable\_cloud\_guard | Determines whether the Cloud Guard service should be enabled. If true, Cloud Guard is enabled and the root compartment is configured with a Cloud Guard target, as long as there is no pre-existing Cloud Guard target for the root compartment (or target creation will fail). Keep in mind that once you set this to true, Cloud Guard target is managed by Landing Zone. If later on you switch this to false, the managed target is deleted and all (open, resolved and dismissed) problems associated with the deleted target are moved to 'deleted' state. This operation happens in the background and would take some time to complete. Deleted problems can be viewed from the problems page using the 'deleted' status filter. For more details on Cloud Guard problems lifecycle, see [Problem Lifecycle](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/cloud-guard/using/problems-page-about.htm#problems-page-about__sect_prob_lifecycle).

| sz\_security\_policies | Additional Security Zones Policy OCIDs to add to security zone recipe (The default policies are added based on CIS level).

LIGHTWEIGHT: If more than 80% of the CIS benchmarks fail, then the target is assigned a risk level of High. NONE: disables cis benchmark scanning. | `string` | `MEDIUM` | no |
